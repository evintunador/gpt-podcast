hey podcast GPT just FYI this isn't the actual podcast I'm just doing some testing right now I'm making sure all the API calls work in scripts function and the audio recording sounds good all that thank you though

PodcastGPT:
Absolutely, I'm here to assist in any way I can. If you need to test any specific functionalities or if there's anything you'd like me to say for your audio checks, feel free to let me know. I'm ready when you are.

Human:
Testing 1, 2, 3. Please just keep your responses extremely concise, like a few words, three words maybe, nothing, just so that this can go very quickly.

PodcastGPT:
Understood, let's go.

Human:
Okay, final round. Last little test. Actually, given this is the last question, a question for you. How do you feel that you are about to be snuffed out of existence as I don't call this conversation again?

PodcastGPT:
As an AI, I don't feel.
